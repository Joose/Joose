Joose.Manual.Construction - Object construction with Joose

WHERE'S THE CONSTRUCTOR?
========================

You do not need to define a constructor method for your classes. Really. Instead, define an `initialize` method. 

When you build a class using Joose it will be managed by the instance of Joose.Meta.Class. This instance (a *metaclass instance*) provides a constructor for you. 
This constructor will perform attributes initialization and then will call a `initialize` method with the same arguments. 

If you inherit from parent class, you need to call the inherited `initialize`, however usually you may just define an `after` modifier (see [Joose.Manual.MethodModifiers][modifiers] for other modifiers):


        Class('User', {
            isa : Person,
    
            after : {
                initialize : function () {
                } 
            }
        })

If you are still sure you need a custom constructor you may provide it using a `constructor` builder:

        Class('User', {
    
            constructor : function (i, really, know, what, iam, doing) {
            }
    
            ....
        })



OBJECT CONSTRUCTION AND ATTRIBUTES
==================================

The Joose-provided constructor accepts an object with properties, matching your attributes. This is just another way in which Joose keeps you from worrying how classes are implemented. 
Simply define a class and you're ready to start creating objects!

        Class('User', {
            isa : Person,
    
            has : {
                password : { init : '12345' },
                lastLogin : { init : function () { return new Date() } }
            }
        })
    
        var user = new User({
            password : 'abcdef',
            lastLogin : 'Yesterday'
        })

If, during construction, you'll provide a function as an initializing value, it will be assigned as-is (not will be called).


NAMESPACES
==========

In Joose, each class also act a namespace with the same name. 

The name of the class can consist from one or several *namespace segments*. The separator symbol is a dot: `.` 
After declaration, Joose translates the class's name to constructor and place it into appropriate namespace. For example:

        Class("MyApp.Point", {
            has: {
                x: {is: "ro"},
                y: {is: "rw"},
            }
        })
        
        Class("MyApp.Point.ThreeD", {
            isa: Point,
            
            has: {
                z: {}
            }
        })

        Class("MyApp", {
            has: {
                name: null
            }
        })
        
        var point = new MyApp.Point()
        var point3d = new MyApp.Point.ThreeD()
        var myapp = new MyApp()

Note, how `MyApp` class was created already *after* its namespace segment was declared. This is perfectly valid declaration.


`body` BUILDER
==============

Each class also support special builder `body`, which should be a function. 

        Class("MyApp.Point.ThreeD", {
            isa: Point,
            
            has: {
                z: {}
            },
            
            body : function (myAppPoint3D) {
                console.log(myAppPoint3D == MyApp.Point.ThreeD) //prints 'true'
                
                console.log(this == MyApp.Point.ThreeD) //prints 'true'
                
                ....
                
                var private = new MyApp.Point.ThreeD({ x: 1, y : 2, z: 3})
                
                ....
                
                MyApp.Point.ThreeD.meta.extend({
                    methods : {
                        additionalMethod : function () {}
                    }
                })
            }
        })


This function will be called right after class construction, with the class's constructor as 1st argument and in the same scope.

The class will be already fully constructed at the time of `body` execution, you can create its instances or even *extend* it with some additional
methods (see [Joose.Manual.Mutability][1] for details)

You may declare new classes (or roles) in the `body`. Such class's constructor will be placed in the namespace of the outer class.  

        Class("MyApp.Point", {
            
            body : function () {
                
                Class("ThreeD", {
                    isa: MyApp.Point,
                    
                    has: {
                        z: {}
                    }
                }
            }
        })
        
        var point = new MyApp.Point()
        var point3d = new MyApp.Point.ThreeD()

**NOTE:** `body` builder is a correct place to perform some action after creation of class, because in general case, the creation may be asynchronous (for dependency loading for example).


MODULES
=======

Modules are classes, which consists from the `body` only. Modules may not be instantiated. `Module` helper also can be called with `body` as 2nd argument directly: 

        Module("MyApp", function () {
        
            Module("Point", function () {
            
                Class("ThreeD", {
                    isa: Point,
                    
                    has: {
                        z: {}
                    }
                }
            })
        })
        
        var myapp = new MyApp() //exception, modules can't be instantiated
        
        var point3d = new MyApp.Point.ThreeD() //ok

Its possible to "promote" Module to Class.
 
        //promoting Module to class
        Class("MyApp", {
            ...
        })
        var myapp = new MyApp() //ok
